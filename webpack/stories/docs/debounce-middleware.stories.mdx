# Debounce Middleware

This middleware will delay an action invocation by a provided debounce miliseconds.
the action must provide a `key` and `debounce` params, and on its first run the middleware
will register that running debounced action by its key in the redux store.
later whenever that action with that specific key is called again,
the middleware will look up to the store to check if the debounce is active.
